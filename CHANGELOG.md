# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) — see `docs/VERSIONING.md` for the rules we apply.

Each release links to the tracker card(s) that drove it; the tracker is the single source of truth for rationale.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `docs/VERSIONING.md`, `docs/UPDATING.md`, this CHANGELOG. (#101)
- `scripts/release.ts` — version-agreement + tag automation. (#101)

## [2.5.0] — 2026-04-17

The Note table widens to carry any author/kind/metadata payload. Still additive — legacy shape-only callers continue to work.

### Added

- `Note` table gains `kind`, `author`, `cardId`, `boardId`, `metadata`, `expiresAt` as optional columns. (#86)
- `createNote` / `listNotes` / `updateNote` tools accept the new fields; `listNotes` filters by `kind`, `cardId`, `boardId`, `author`. (#86)
- tRPC `note.list` accepts the same filter set.

### Changed

- `SCHEMA_VERSION` 6 → 7.
- `MCP_SERVER_VERSION` 2.4.0 → 2.5.0.

## [2.4.0] — 2026-03 (Claim table shipped)

First cut of the unified knowledge primitive — the `Claim` row type, with MCP tools to write and list.

### Added

- `Claim` table — `kind`, `projectId`, `statement`, `body`, `evidence` (JSON), `payload` (JSON), `author`, `cardId`, `status`, `supersedesId`, `supersededById`, `recordedAtSha`, `verifiedAt`, `expiresAt`. (#86)
- `saveClaim`, `listClaims` MCP tools. (#86)

### Changed

- `SCHEMA_VERSION` 5 → 6.
- `MCP_SERVER_VERSION` 2.3.0 → 2.4.0.

## [2.3.0] — 2026-02 (session continuity)

### Added

- `endSession` essential MCP tool — wraps handoff save + summary emission for clean agent shutdown. (#62)
- `briefMe` essential tool (session primer with pulse, handoff, top work, open decisions).

### Changed

- `MCP_SERVER_VERSION` 2.2.0 → 2.3.0.

## Before 2.3.0

Earlier history is captured in the git log. Highlights:

- Phase 3 ship (UI: command palette, SSE real-time updates, optimistic UI).
- AI Context Engine (20 tools, 5 models, MCP resources, version detection).
- Initial local-first kanban board with MCP integration.

Reconstructed entries below this point are best-effort; treat git log as authoritative.
